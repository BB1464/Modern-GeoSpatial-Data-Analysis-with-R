# Modern GeoSpatial Data Analysis with R


## Oluwafemi Oyedele| NHS-R:Conf(2022)

## Overview

Creating maps with R is an efficient and reproducible way of communicating insight to stakeholders. This workshop would expose participant to the modern workflow in geospatial analysis with R. An explosion of packages for working with spatial data, means you can ditch your GIS software and do geospatial analysis in R end-to-end in a more reproducible way. This workshop would expose participant on how to read, manipulate and visualize spatial data in R and participant in this workshop would be exposed to functionality that would course them to say ‘’I didn’t  know you could do that in R!.


**Learning objectives**:

- How spatial data can be integrated into data science workflows, how to manipulate, and make sense of spatial data.

- Participant would learn key strategies for getting spatial data into R

- Participant would learn the different type of coordinate reference system

- Participant would learn about the different types of spatial data

- Participant would learn how to create static and interactive maps with R

Participant that would attend this workshop do not need to have any previous knowledge on geospatial analysis in R, but they must be proficient with R. Example they should be familiar with the tidyverse.
